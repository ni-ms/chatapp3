#To do
1. Separate the chat rooms [DONE]
2. add the skip functionality [Somewhat done]
    when a user presses skip, reset the other users connection
3. Add video and audio chat
4. Make sure it works with multiple tags [ Done ]
5. Fix the gender thing [ DONE ]


To Fix:

- Whenever someone skips thereâ€™s no notification
- What if 2 person skips at the same time
- if u are not connected it should show
- when finding a match for a user, if says all the people in a nth matched tags are skipped, now find the people in the (n-1)th matched tags for the user


To Fix:
If a user is skipped, shouldn't be matched with the same user in the next search.
optimize it for popular tags ( make it dynamic )
benchmark it
